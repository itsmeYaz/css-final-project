            <p>Rimuru Tempest</p>
            <p>Rimuru Tempest is a central character in the light novel and anime series "That Time I Got Reincarnated
               as a
               Slime"
               (Tensei Shitara Suraimu Datta Ken), written by Fuse and illustrated by Mitz Vah. Rimuru begins his
               journey
               as an
               ordinary human, but after an unfortunate incident, he finds himself reincarnated into a fantasy world as
               a
               slimeâ€”a lowly
               creature in the hierarchy of monsters.</p>
